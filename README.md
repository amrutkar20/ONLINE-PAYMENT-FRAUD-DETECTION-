# ONLINE-PAYMENT-FRAUD-DETECTION-
In this machine learning project, we solve the problem of detecting online transactions fraud detecting using machine numpy, scikit learn, and few other python libraries.We overcome the problem by creating a binary classifier and experimenting with various machine learning techniques to see which fits better.
